                            So let's say that you do make everything work like Word, or worse, your content editors
                            actually are using Word to write content for thee site. Either way, you start with
                            essentially unstructured content.

                            While you could just post content directly after that, your site will quickly start to
                            become messy. The more content creators you add, the less your content will have a
                            unified voice. Posts of the same kind will lack similar structures.

                            Larger organizations with a larger number of content creators will also start to build

                            The first option is to just force mobile users to use the desktop site. While many mobile

                            scroll, and repeat. Needless to say, it sucks.

                            So the desktop site won't work. Let's just make a separate site for mobile, that'll fix it,
                            right? Well, no. Your content is still desktop-sized, and you're trying to squeeze it into
                            a tiny screen. This can include callouts, embedded media, and pagination that seem natural
                            on the desktop, but intrusive and odd on mobile. Our content is a problem in of itself.
                            Separating the sites isn't enough, we need to separate our channels.

                            misinterpret the title and skip your content altogether.

                            When we categorize content, we can immediately see that different types contain different
                            data. This picture node is very different from this page node. The picture has an image file
                            and some metadata on how to display the image. The page, on the other hand, just as a body
                            of text to display.

                            title and body. The fields are the same. So what makes them different?

                            Well, these two are different not because of different fields, but their use case. That is,
                            the different ways they are displayed or managed. For a blog post, you generally want to
                            know the author that wrote it. For a page -- like an "About Us" page -- the author isn't
                            important. So even while the page has an author, we don't display it to visitors. The
                            different ways we use content also makes something a different type.

                            When creating a content type, the site builder can also define zero or more custom fields.
                            There's a lot of different kinds of fields you can use, including rich content for the
                            body field.
