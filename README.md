Intro to Content Types
======================

A [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) presentation for the Twin Cities Drupalcamp Session, "Intro to Content Types"

Summary
-------

Your content creators are angry, your SEO's head-desking, and you're drowning in WYSIWYG buttons. Your site is full of blobby, inflexible pages. Chunk 'em up with content types!

Today we need to think beyond just pages. It's about discrete pieces of content that can be leveraged in a myriad of ways. In this session, you'll be introduced to how Drupal organizes content into types. You'll see how to use fields to break out of the WYSIWYG and build adaptable content packages that fit into your overall content strategy.

This introductory session is for new users of Drupal and those needing a primer on the basics of Drupal content construction. No prior Drupal experience is necessary!
